# Guessing-Game-201
Assignment for Code 201. Created a guessing game. Where the user is asked a series of yes or no questions with a bonus question that involves guessing a number.

### What I learned:
- seperation of concerns
- while loops
- if/else statements, now in a function
- adding a counter
- added images to the background and as indicators for the user responses. 

###Resources:
